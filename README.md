parallax features using two different methodologies (javascript - recalculate scrolltop (works on ipad and mobile) and background fixed (css) which is problematical on mobile iOS devices but works fine on desktop.  

The website has been deployed on Heroku with Node.  The website is non-commercial and purely for educational purposes only.
